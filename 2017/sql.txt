7.temporary table; tempdb
	temporary table can be define with # or ## in front of table name.
	temporary tables are saved in tempdb, when use OBJECT_ID() function
	to retrieve temporary tables' id, database name must be explicitly specified.
	for example: IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb.dbo.#tblname', 'U') IS NOT NULL

8. Exist Keyword
	SQL statements that use the EXISTS condition are very inefficient since the sub-query is RE-RUN for EVERY row in the outer query's table. 
	There are more efficient ways to write most queries, that do not use the EXISTS condition.
